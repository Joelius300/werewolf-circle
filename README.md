# Werewolf circle
This is a web application which can be used to simulate a player circle for playing Werewolf online (e.g. in a video call).  
I started this project during rough covid times after having a bit of trouble playing Werewolf with friends in Discord since the camera tiles weren't aligned the same way for everyone so roles with positional abilities couldn't be used. Unfortunately school took up a lot of time until mid 2021 so I couldn't finish it yet and now the covid situation has gotten a lot better. This means I'm not going to finish this project just yet but I've planned it through pretty well I think so maybe I'll come back and finish it sometime in the future.
